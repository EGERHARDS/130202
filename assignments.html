                On this page you will find a deeper overview of the development process behind the two DfD assignments. I will also try to give a brief but sufficient information on the tools I used in this assignment.

            <h3>13C.01.01 Fonts and UI components</h3>

            <p>
                In this task, I had to redesign a template of a website with the focus on choosing the right font hierarchy.
            </p>
            <section class="gallery">
                <figure><img src="graphics/01-colors.png" alt="Colors"><figcaption>Image 1. Finding a color palette with <i>Huemint</i>.</figcaption></figure>
               
                <p>
                    I started off with choosing the color palette which felt more interesting than the given grayscale palette. By using <i>Huemint</i> and <i>Adobe Color</i>, I managed to find a color palette that would look good as well as make sense in terms of contrast and other design principles.

                <figure><img src="graphics/01-typescale.png" alt="Font finding"><figcaption>Image 2. Assessing the right font on <i>Typescale</i> and planning how to apply the various sizes to the site.</figcaption></figure>
                
                <p>
                    Next, I moved onto browsing <i>Google Fonts</i> and finding a font that would feel right for the site. As the content given in the assignment was not of a specific subject, I was able to freely choose a font that I liked aesthetically. I then moved onto testing the font out on <i>Typescale</i> in order to see if using just this one font would work with its different sizes for different elements. Thankfully, it did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the end I applied the chosen colors and fonts to my site, and made some final visual adjustments. The best thing with making adjustments at this stage was how easy it was, thanks to the usage of CSS variables. With just a few clicks I was able to change all of the colors and fonts on the site, therfore, easily testing which version looked the best.

              13C.01.02 Working with colors and animations
            </h3>
           
           <section class="gallery">
            <p>
              In this assignment, I had to do another redesign - this time, however, focusing on usage of color on the site.
            </p>

            <figure><img src="graphics/02-colors.png" alt="Colors"><figcaption>Image 4. Analyzing the contrast of a color pallette on <i>Adobe Color</i>.</figcaption></figure>
               
                <p>
                    As more focus had to be put on the colors of the site, I put a larger emphasis on taking my time to adjust a color palette on <i>Adobe Color</i>. Different types of palettes were tested, however, due to the following steps of the assignment, I decided to go with a palette whose accent color would not be too "out-there". This was done in order to not complicate the process of creating the site's "Dark Mode" version.
                </p>

                <figure><img src="graphics/02-colors2.png" alt="Font finding"><figcaption>Image 5. The solution in its standard mode.</figcaption></figure>
                
                <p>
                    Here, I have applied the finished color palette of the standard version of the site. Choosing these colors made it clearer for myself to understand what elements I should focus on in order to create the Dark Mode.
                </p>
                
                <figure><img src="graphics/02-darkmode.png" alt="Colors"><figcaption>Image 6. The solution with Dark Mode enabled.</figcaption></figure>
            
                <p>
                    In this screenshot, the Dark Mode has been enabled via the button in the Navigation bar (which includes a small animation inforrming the user of the current status). The chosen accent color makes it easier to keep the site's (potentially, a brand's) imagery while stripping down the excess colors from the highlighted areas such as the Navigation bar. 
                </p>
